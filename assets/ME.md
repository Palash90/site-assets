## My journey so far
Growing up, I was always curious about how things worked – especially computers. That curiosity led me to pursue a **Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology** from the College of Engineering and Management, Kolaghat, where I dove into programming and began to understand the power of code.

From there, my professional journey took flight, starting as a **Programmer Analyst** at Cognizant Technology Solutions in Kolkata. Those early years were humbling and transformative, pushing me to learn quickly and adapt. Over the years, I moved between companies like **HCL Technologies**, **Oracle India Pvt. Ltd.**, and **GE Renewable Energy**, each role sharpening my skills and deepening my understanding of software engineering. I worked my way up to my current position as a **Cloud Developer III** at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in Bengaluru, where I’m able to leverage my experience across Java, Python, C#, and recently, Rust.

### The Balance of Tech and Music

While engineering is my career, music is my therapy. Somewhere along the way, I picked up a guitalele, and it became more than a hobby – it was a way to express creativity and relax. Today, I share that passion on my YouTube channel, creating tutorials for fellow guitalele enthusiasts. This balance of tech and music keeps me grounded and reminds me that there's more to life than lines of code.

### My Philosophy

> "Software Engineering is what I do for a living, music is what I do to live."

Balancing my technical career with creative pursuits keeps me grounded and inspired. Outside of work, I’m a passionate musician and run a **guitalele tutorial channel**. Music offers me a refreshing counterpoint to my engineering journey, where I express creativity in a different language.
