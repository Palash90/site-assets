## Market Overview
### Global Smoking Statistics:
- **Over 8 million people die each year** as a result of smoking, with more than **7 million of these deaths** being the result of direct tobacco use, and approximately **1.2 million due to non-smokers being exposed to secondhand smoke** (WHO).
- Around **1 billion people** worldwide currently smoke, and many are at high risk of developing chronic diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- In the United States alone, **cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths each year**, representing nearly **1 in 5 deaths**. Smoking-related illnesses cost the U.S. over **$300 billion annually**, including more than **$170 billion** for direct medical care and more than **$156 billion** in lost productivity.

### The Problem:
- **Addiction**: Nicotine is highly addictive, and quitting smoking is difficult for many people due to withdrawal symptoms and emotional triggers.
- **Anxiety and Stress**: Smoking often serves as a coping mechanism for stress or anxiety. When individuals attempt to quit, they experience heightened anxiety and cravings, making it harder to stay smoke-free.
- **Relapse**: Most individuals who try to quit relapse within a year, and many require multiple attempts before succeeding. Traditional methods such as nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), counseling, or medications do not fully address the psychological and physiological aspects of smoking addiction.
