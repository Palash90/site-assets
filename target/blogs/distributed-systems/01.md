# Distributed Systems
Imagine your day to day life, many things you do, you do through networked systems.

For example, you want to listen to a song you open spotify, you want to watch a video you open youtube, you want something you open amazon, want to talk to friend may be you use WhatsApp video call or other video chatting services. Similarly, you use Zomato, Blinkit, Zepto and what not.

Internet has changed the way we live in this world. But pause for a moment and think would Internet still be so popular if the day to day services you use today won't be available all the time for all the users???

Internet has become ubiquitos  because, the networked services are always waiting to serve you at your fingertips.

Isn't this beautiful???
It definitely is, but how do they do that???

This whole series will get into the crux of it. Stay tuned.
