# Techniques to achieve reliability
## Write Ahead Log
Write a line of log with operations to be performed before actually performing. If the machine crashes in between, then it can restore from last state. Databases use it. Also good for replication.
For example, Alice transfers Bob 500 rupees.
Operations: Read Alice Balance, Read Bob balance, update alice balance, update bob balance.
If there is a failure in between, node can restart from log on the state before failure.
Tools it uses: CRC

## Leader Follower
If multiple nodes perform conflicting updates, instead of letting them perform, we let the leader take the control.
