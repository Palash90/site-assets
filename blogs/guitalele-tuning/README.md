# Guitalele Basics and Tuning of the Instrument 
tldr;
From top to bottom, you get this tuning - A2 D3 G3 C4 E4 A4

## Guitalele Basics
Guitalele is a guitar like instrument. It is however, tuned more like an Ukulele. It has a slightly bigger body than an Ukulele but smaller than standard Guitar.

The neck of Guitalele is more like a Classical Guitar but with a shorter height like a Tenor or Baritone Ukulele.

All in all, the instrument is a perfect hybrid of Guitar and Ukulele.

It has nice tonal quality which makes this instrument unique. It is not too bassy like a guitar but not too trebbly like an ukulele. A perfect blend of this tonal quality is much suited for many country songs and classicals.

## The Tuning
As I mentioned the instrument is more tuned like an ukulele. In fact, the thinnest 4 strings of this instrument actually resemble the tuning that of an ukulele. However, in this respect, I am considering a Low G tuning of ukulele.

So, you can think of this instrument as a Low G tuned Tenor Ukulele with two extra bass strings. The tuning scheme however is that of a Guitar. Thus, you get the tuning A2, D3, G3, C4, E4, A4

In other words, this is the same tuning you get if you put a capo on the fifth fret of a guitar. However, guitalele has a less bass response than guitar.
