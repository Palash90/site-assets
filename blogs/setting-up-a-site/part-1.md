# Hosting a website online from scratch - Part 1
This will be a multi-part series on how to host a website on internet from scratch. This will be a developer focused series and if you are a developer and want to host your website, keep on reading. You may get some idea of the process.

## Motivation
I have my domain acquired almost a decade now. This is the third time, I am deploying a website on my domain. The last time what I deployed on my domain, was just my Resume. Over the years, I have used some subdomains to showcase some of my past projects. However, they were scattered over places.

This was bugging me for quite a long time. As I was not utilizing the space to its full potential. So, I thought of changing the status quo.

## The requirements
This is the very first step on starting a new project. You have to understand what you want to build. So, I jotted down the things I expect my website to have. To do this, I hopped around various personal sites and tried to find how others have come up with their websites.

These are the list of high level things, I want my website to have:
1. It should have a space for a quick introduction
1. It should have a space for my personal projects to showcase
1. It should have a space to display my notes  on technical learnings and implementations
1. It should have a space for my recently picked up music hobbies
1. It should give me a space to display my job experiences
1. Optionally, I thought of giving a unique touch to my mail address as well
1. Over the years, I could not maintain my last website because, it was quite a chore to put anything on it. So, a big motivator would be get things out of window as easy as possible

## The tools in my arsenal
This is the phase where I took a moment to reflect on what we build and what we already have. This is the phase where ideas should meet the reality.

I already know how to develop web applications using javascript and react.js with some exposure to css. I am not designer or hard core front end developer. I am a back end heavy full stack developer. So, I would be able to start up the basics and can pick up things on the way.

Also, I don't aspire to build a highly sophisticated graphics heavy or too interactive 3d.js or other library website. My requirements are simple, so a simple layout should do fine.

## The design
Once I jotted down the basic requirements and checked the tools, I started thinking of how to implement.

The very first thing that comes to mind is the layout. How the web page should look like. May not be to the exact point, but some rough design work should be done at first, then you can go for design.

For my case, I had some idea of having 4 pages in my website, that I want to host. I drew them on the page to think around the next step. Following is what I came up in the first draft. The right now website is almost the same one, except that few things have been added and shifted little here and there.
