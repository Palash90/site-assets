# Hosting a website online from scratch - Building the application
Once I was done gathering the requirements, followed by designing the web app and choosing libraries, it was time for me to dive depper into the build process.

The first thing that hit me was the way to handle different pages. I wanted all the pages to have a distinct url, so that it will be easily bookmarked. The very first thing that I came up with designing the routes that I will have in my website. I started with 4 urls initially for each of the page in the design phase.
